# Phase 7 — Mastery & Internal Leverage

Goal
- Translate learnings into reproducible packages, stress-tested strategies, and internal-facing reports suitable for stakeholders.

Description
- Focus on robustness, reproducibility, stress testing, and preparing internal presentations or documentation for adoption or review by others.

Weekly goals
- Week 37–40: Apply strategies to organizationally relevant universes and compute comparative performance metrics.
- Week 41–44: Run stress tests, edge-case analyses, and ensure reproducibility of results.
- Week 45–48: Consolidate the GitHub portfolio, prepare an internal presentation/report, and capture lessons learned.

## Detailed Focus Areas by Week Block

### Weeks 37–40: Organizational Alignment
- **Day-by-day example (Week 37)**:
  - Day 1: Identify internal asset universe and data sources
  - Day 2: Adapt data pipeline to internal systems
  - Day 3: Run strategies on internal universe
  - Day 4: Benchmark against internal benchmarks or existing models
  - Day 5: Analyze differences and document findings
  - Day 6: Create comparison report for stakeholders
  - Day 7: Commit internal-adapted notebooks

### Weeks 41–44: Stress Testing & Robustness
- Scenario analysis (financial crises, flash crashes, regime shifts)
- Parameter sensitivity analysis
- Out-of-sample validation across multiple periods
- Monte Carlo simulation of strategy outcomes
- Reproducibility verification (different machines, environments)

### Weeks 45–48: Documentation & Knowledge Transfer
- Internal presentation creation
- Comprehensive documentation
- Code cleanup and packaging
- Lessons learned write-up
- Stakeholder demos and feedback

## Optional Extensions (skip if time-constrained)

### Advanced Risk Management (Research Focus)
- **Liquidity risk modeling**: Time-to-liquidate analysis under stress
- **Model risk**: Quantify uncertainty from model assumptions
  - Compare multiple models (ensemble approach)
  - Track model performance degradation over time
- **Tail risk analysis**: Extreme value theory, fat-tailed distributions
- **Regime-dependent risk**: Different risk measures in different market states

### Execution Analysis (Research, not implementation)
- **Market impact models**: Study Almgren-Chriss framework theoretically
- **Optimal execution theory**: Understand trade-off between impact and timing risk
- **Transaction cost analysis**: Post-trade analysis methodologies
- **Pre-trade cost estimation**: Predict costs before execution

### Advanced Mathematical Topics
- **Causal inference in finance**: Which factors truly drive returns vs correlation?
  - Granger causality tests
  - Structural breaks detection
- **Optimal control theory**: Apply to portfolio and execution problems
- **Game theory**: Strategic interactions in markets
- **Information theory**: Entropy-based portfolio construction

### Attribution & Explanation
- **Shapley values**: Fair attribution of returns to factors/strategies
- **Counterfactual analysis**: What would have happened without this alpha?
- **Factor importance over time**: Track which factors matter when
- **Regime analysis**: Identify when strategies work vs fail

### Reproducibility & Documentation
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every assumption, data source, method
- **Code documentation**: Docstrings, type hints, clear variable names
- **Research notebooks**: Literate programming approach
- **Version control**: Tag important milestones, maintain changelog

### Knowledge Synthesis
- **Lessons learned**: Comprehensive summary of 18+ months
- **What worked vs what didn't**: Honest retrospective
- **Research questions generated**: Future directions and open problems
- **Personal growth tracking**: Skills developed, knowledge gained

### Academic Rigor
- **Literature review**: Connect your work to academic research
- **Statistical significance**: Proper hypothesis testing throughout
- **Multiple testing corrections**: Bonferroni, FDR when exploring many alphas
- **Publication-quality write-ups**: LaTeX documents for key findings
