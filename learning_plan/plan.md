# Learning Plan — Phases Overview

This repository is organized by numbered phases. Each phase has its own file (phase0.md through phase10.md) with a clear Goal, Description, Weekly goals, and Daily goals you can follow and customize.

Open the phase files to see detailed tasks and checklists.

## Phases (short descriptions)

1. Phase 0 — Setup
	- Short: Create repository structure, install tools, and prepare data workflows. See `phase0.md`.
2. Phase 1 — Statistical Refresher
	- Short: Rebuild core statistics and regression intuition with applied notebooks. See `phase1.md`.
3. Phase 2 — Financial Data Foundations
	- Short: Pull and clean financial data, compute returns, and implement basic factor regressions. See `phase2.md`.
4. Phase 3 — Alpha Experiment 1
	- Short: Implement and backtest a first alpha strategy (e.g., momentum). See `phase3.md`.
5. Phase 4 — Stochastic Processes & Simulation
	- Short: Simulate price processes and run Monte Carlo experiments (GBM, options). See `phase4.md`.
6. Phase 5 — Alpha Experiment 2
	- Short: Build a second, more advanced alpha (multi-factor) and validate with walk-forward tests. See `phase5.md`.
7. Phase 6 — Portfolio & Public Visibility
	- Short: Combine strategies into a portfolio, automate reporting, and polish GitHub deliverables. See `phase6.md`.
8. Phase 7 — Mastery & Internal Leverage
	- Short: Translate results to internal stakeholders, stress tests, and consolidate documentation. See `phase7.md`.
9. Phase 8 — Fixed Income & Interest Rate Models
	- Short: Master yield curves, Vasicek/CIR/Hull-White models, HJM framework, LIBOR market models. See `phase8.md`.
10. Phase 9 — Credit Risk & Credit Derivatives
	- Short: Structural models (Merton), reduced form models, copulas, CDS and CDO pricing. See `phase9.md`.
11. Phase 10 — Numerical Methods for Derivatives
	- Short: Finite difference methods, tree methods, advanced Monte Carlo, multi-dimensional pricing. See `phase10.md`.
